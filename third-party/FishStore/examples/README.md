# Examples
This folder contains examples to use and extend FishStore for data ingestion and PSF queries (record retrieval). This is a quick start manual to run them on your own computer.

# Datasets
There are several public dataset available online you can use to try out FishStore. In our examples, we the following data sets:

- [Github Archive](https://www.gharchive.org/): A project to record the public GitHub timeline, archive it, and make it easily accessible for further analysis.
- Twitter: You can crawl twitter data using its developer API. [Here](https://github.com/bianjiang/tweetf0rm) is a open source crawler you can use.

You can download them by yourself and use them as test data of our examples.
